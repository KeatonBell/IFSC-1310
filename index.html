<h1>Dragon Project and Reflection</h1>
<p>I asked my family for feedback on the first iteration of the website. They gave me the idea to have a rocket flying across the screen in the background. I tried to get this to work, but with the knowledge I have now I wasn’t able to accomplish that. So, to have some type of java script in my code I settled with adding in the slide show. I was disappointed that I could not get it to work, but with more experience and learning I think I could get it to work.</p>

<p> If I were to be honest, I learned that any type of code just isn’t for me. While you as a teacher were able to keep me engaged and excited to learn more I just do not excel at any type of coding.  I did learn that if there was a language, I had to become good at it for a career it would be the web design side. I liked knowing that nearly anything I can imagine can be done, it is just a matter of me knowing or learning how to do it. </p>

<p> I think that I did well at coming up with ideas and having the creativity to think about what could be done. I wish that I could have some of things I envision being able to do come to fruition, but with short time we had in the class I might just be 5% of the way there. </p>

<p> I didn’t receive much feedback except for the rocket idea. As I stated before I tried for multiple days to get it to work, but I couldn’t succeed. I do plan on trying to get it work on my own time, because of the amount of time I did put into trying to make it work.</p>
<h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
<p>Progressive enhancement seems very intuitive and efficient. With a good HTML file that has no errors you always have a website that is functional. If the CSS and Java Script fail users will still be able to use the website. This is very important, because if the HTML has errors, then it will all fall apart from there. </p>
<P>I also agree that focusing on creating a website that is appealing to the eye with CSS primarily is a goo practice as well. CSS is much less of a strain on the computer which is very beneficial for older devices. Web developers must remember that technology advances at a rate that some people can’t keep up with, and still have iPhone 5’s or still running a windows 7 computer. This need to be thought about before adding thousands of lines of Java Script that will take 5 minutes to compute correctly or not run right at all. </P>
<p>I do think Java Script is a very essential too to web development. It allows to do more than just animations and cool effects. It is what thousands of companies use for data collection, and algorithms that can help their company tremendously. So, at the end of the day, it all just a balance, but a house is built from the ground up. Just like any website created should be as well. </p>
